# Toon-Tanks

This project was made whilst following the GameDev.tv course [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) during the Toon Tanks section. This section of the course covered actor movement using player input, projectile movement, hit events, timers and basic special effects.

Once the section was completed, I added some features of my own to further push my learning. These include multiple levels, multiple enemy types including basic AI behavior, additional sound effects and music, a main menu system, scoring and HUD widgets.
